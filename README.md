This repository is a copy of the one used during development, however it was done through Github classroom, preventing us from making the repo public.

Project Duration/Timeline: January to April 2022 (No plans for further updates).

Context: This was a team project (3 people) for Introduction to Game Design (CISC 226) where we had to create an original 2d web-based game. 

Latest version of the game: v0.1

Play our game yourself [here](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/monkey-marathon-v0-1).

Read how to play [here](./HowToPlay.md).

Watch gameplay demo [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4vsoj9cuk4).

For the course, we had to submit several reports and other deliverables. Most of them have been included, with the basic purpose described below:

- [Game Proposal](./game-proposal.pdf): We had to submit a project proposal before starting the game, including the mechanics, features, novelty of the game, objective, etc. Note: This is only what we planned to do before starting development, what we actually did does vary slightly, including some mechanics we didn't have time to implement.
- [Playtesting and Progress Report](./playtesting-and-progress-report.pdf): This was a report we wrote roughly 2/3 of the way through development, which included progress so far, what we planned to accomplish with the last 1/3 of the time, and results from playtesting. In addition to the 3 developers playtesting the game, we also had 3 non-developers playtest the game, give feedback, as well as fill out a PXI questionare to quantitatively assess difference aspect of our game. Said filled out PXI questionaires can be found [here](./PXI_questionnaires). Playtesting was done with version 0.02.3 of the game. This feedback was obviously used to improve the game.
- [Progress Demo](./progress_demo.mp4): This demo with voiceover was made at the same time as the progress report, using version 0.02.3. The purpose of this is to demonstrate the progress of our game after 2/3 of the total development time. Note: This demo does not show the completed game (version 0.1).
- [Final Report + Contributions](./final-report-and-contributions.pdf): This report outlines basic instructions, known bugs, and other wrap-up information about the project. This report also contains a list of each team member's contributions to the project.
